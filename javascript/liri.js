Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.
Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.
